## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is David. I'm a software developer from Ecuador, currently enrolled in a master's degree in software engineering in Spain. I like software development and I believe I have a calling for it.

ðŸ”­ I'm working for a consulting firm with a client in the banking sector. I use microservices and public clouds to deploy them.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reactive programming and some IA integrations.
